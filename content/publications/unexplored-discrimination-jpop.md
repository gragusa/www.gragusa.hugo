We study labor-market discrimination of individuals with &ldquo;specific&ldquo; characteristics in Italy. We conduct a field experiment in two Italian cities: Rome and Milan, by sending &ldquo;fake&ldquo; CVs to real ads. We find that there is a strong penalty for homosexuals, i.e., about 30% less chance to be called back compared to a heterosexual male and even more so if they are highly skilled. On the other hand, we find no penalty for homosexual females. We also find a beauty premium for females only but this premium is much lower when the &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; woman is skilled.
