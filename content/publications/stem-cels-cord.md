Background
----------

Rapid identification of eligible cord blood units (CBUs) for banking is an important number in hematopoietic stem cell procurement. Distinct contents of CD34+

Study Design and Methods
------------------------

Considering thresholds of CD34+ cell content of $3 × 10^6$, $2 × 10^6$, and $1 × 10^6$ CD34+ cells, we analyzed a consecutive series of 1309 CBUs. CBUs were co

Results
-------

Median total nucleated cell (TNC) and CD34+ cell counts of the series were $6.97 × 10^8$ (range, $0.36 × 10^8-34.9 × 10^8$) and $1.47 × 10^6$ $(0-20.56 × 10^6)$

Conclusions
-----------

This analysis, carried out on a large, unrestricted CBU series, shows that TNC alone is the best predictor of distinct targets of hematopoietic potential with
