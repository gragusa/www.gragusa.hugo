Time Series Econometrics is aimed at students who wish to gain a working knowledge of the modern methods used in macroeconomics and to some extent in finance.

By the end of the course, students will have gained a good understanding of time series econometrics ranging from classic tools such as linear stationary processes (ARMA, VAR) to techniques that have recently entered the macroeconomist toolbox (Bayesian and high dimensional estimation).
