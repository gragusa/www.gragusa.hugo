The course main objective is to provide students with a solid grasp of the
probabilistic and statistical underpinnings of the most common econometric
techniques. The topics studied will be of practical use to any student who plans
on confronting data in their thesis or wishes to read and precisely understand
the econometrics typically used in empirical research published in academic
journals. The recommended software package is [Julia](http://www.julialang.org).

Econometric theory has two parts. The first part focuses on the specification
and estimation of the linear regression models and its extensions. The second
part focuses on the theory and the applications of time series methods in
econometrics.
