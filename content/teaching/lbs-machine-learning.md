This course gives an overview of many techniques, and algorithms in machine learning, beginning with topics such as linear regression and classification and ending up with more recent topics such as boosting, support vector machines, random forests and and unsupervised learning techniques. The course will give the student the ideas and intuition behind modern machine learning methods as well as a bit more formal understanding of how, why, and when they work. The module will use primarily the [R](http://r-project.org) programming language.
