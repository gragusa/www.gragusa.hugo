The course main objective is to provide students with a solid grasp of the
probabilistic and statistical underpinnings of the most common econometric
techniques. The topics studied will be of practical use to any student who plans
on confronting data in their thesis or wishes to read and precisely understand
the econometrics typically used in empirical research published in academic
journals.

**Econometric theory** has two parts:

The **first part** focuses on the specification and estimation of the
linear regression models and its extensions.

The **second part** focuses on the theory and the applications of time
series methods in econometrics.

Throughout, we will focus on both understanding and doing. The understanding will come from lectures, class discussions, and problem solving. The doing will come from extensive statistical software use. This course requires a quarter-long commitment. Econometrics is best learned by doing, and I will require you to do a fair amount of hands-on work. Hands-on work requires the use of computer software. In this class we use [Julia](http://julialang.org).

#### Textbooks

Lectures of the first part of the course will be mostly based on the
following two graduate textbooks:

- Wooldridge, Jeffrey M. Econometric analysis of cross section and panel
  data. MIT press, 2010.

Lectures of the second part will be based on the following textbooks:

- J.D. Hamilton. Time Series Analysis. Princeton University Press, 1994

Another reference is:

- Hal White (2011), Asymptotic Theory for Econometricians, Academic Press

#### Exams and grades

There will be two in class exam. A midterm and a comprehensive final.
The final grade will consist of a weighted average of these two exams
and the problem sets.

The midterm will be held on March 28, 2017.
