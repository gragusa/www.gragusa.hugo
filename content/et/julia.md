[Julia](http://julialang.org) is a high-level, high-performance dynamic
programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is
familiar to users of other technical computing environments. In
particular, its syntax is similar to Matlab. The similarity of the
syntax means that a lot of Matlab code will run almost unmodified.

[Julia](http://julialang.org) has many advantages over other languages and for this reason is being extensively used in industries and in research.

Recently, the [Federal Reserve of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/) has
open sourced its macroeconomic model (used for producing forecast about key
variables and to conduct policy experiment). The code is written in Julia. You
can read about it
[here](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/12/the-frbny-dsge-model-meets-julia.html).
The code is on [github](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl).

An excellent tutorial is
[Programming in Julia](http://quant-econ.net/jl/learning_julia.html).
The tutorial is written by Thomas J. Sargent and John Stachurski. Along
with being a complete textbook with Julia code for macroeconomics, this
also is a very good introduction to Julia
