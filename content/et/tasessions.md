The TAs will lead a weekly practice session which will be held in the computer labs (301 and 306).

The sessions are an important part of the course and regular and
attendance is strongly advised. During these sessions, the TA will review the
concepts introduced in class and solve applied problems using Julia. Sessions are
also useful for asking questions about the problem sets.

The following table gives the distribution of students across the two sessions:

|TA               | Time        | Students  |
|:----------------|:------------|:----------|
|Siria Angino     | 10:15-11:45 | G-Z       |
|Chiara Perricone | 8:45-10:25  | A-I       |
