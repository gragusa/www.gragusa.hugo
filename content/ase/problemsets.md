There will be a weekly problem set. The assignments will involve both theoretical and empirical work. Group study and free discussion are encouraged. But you should submit your own answers. You will probably find the class very hard to follow if you fail to spend sufficient time on all of the problem sets. The problem sets are part of the final grade as explained in the next section below.

If you have any question on the problem sets, please ask me or TAâ€™s during our office hours. Our office hours are for you. I prefer to talk to you in person. I feel that Email is not a very efficient way to ask econometric questions.

Problem set answers are to be turned in on time. You can hand in the homework AFTER the class. Please do not come and hand it in to me whilst I am lecturing. Do not email assignments. Late solution will not be accepted!
