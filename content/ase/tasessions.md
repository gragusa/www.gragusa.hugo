The TAs will lead a weekly practice session which will be held in the computer labs (TBA).

The sessions are an important part of the course and regular and
attendance is strongly advised. During these sessions, the TA will review the concepts introduced in class and solve applied problems using `R`.

Sessions are also useful for asking questions about the problem sets.
