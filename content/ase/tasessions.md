The TAs will lead a weekly practice session which will be held in the computer labs (301 and 306).

The TA sessions are an important part of the course and regular and
attendance is strongly encouraged. During these sessions, the TA will review the concepts introduced in class and solve applied problems using `R`.

The sessions are also the right place to get insight about the problem set of the week.
