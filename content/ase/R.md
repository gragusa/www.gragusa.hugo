The software used in this course is [R](http://r-project.org). No
prior knowledge of this software package is assumed. This package will be
introduced in the TA Sessions.

`R` is installed on all computers in the computer lab. Since
[R](http://r-project.org) is open source you can freely install it on your laptop or
desktop. [R](http://r-project.org) is available for all major computing
platforms: Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. Platform specific installation help can
be found at
[here](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html).

I recommend using `R` through [Rstudio](http://rstudio.com/), a free and open
source integrated development environment (IDE) for `R`.
[Rstudio](http://rstudio.com/) is installed on most computers in the computer
labs where TA sessions are held. You can easily install [Rstudio](http://rstudio.com/)  on your machine by following the instruction [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
