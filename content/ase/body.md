The aim of **Applied Statistics and Econometrics** is to provide an introduction to the practice of econometrics. While both theoretical and practical aspects are covered, emphasis will be on intuitive understanding and concepts will be illustrated with real-world applications.

<!--more-->

Throughout, we will focus on both understanding and doing. The understanding will come from lectures, class discussions, and problem solving. The doing will come from extensive statistical software use. This course requires a quarter-long commitment. Econometrics is best learned by doing, and I will require you to do a fair amount of hands-on work.

For further details about the structure of the course, please download the [syllabus](../files/teaching/syllabus-ase-2017.pdf). The syllabus has information about this course. In particular, it has information on how, where and when to contact me and the teaching assistants; an outline of the course content, the schedule of exam dates; **the grading policy**, and other important organizational details of the course. You can find some of this information on this web page, but not all.  So, please, refer to the [syllabus](../files/teaching/syllabus-ase-2017.pdf) for any questions you may have about the course.
